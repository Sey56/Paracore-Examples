# Deep Dive: How `[RevitElements]` Actually Works

The `[RevitElements]` attribute is the most powerful "Magic" feature of the Paracore Parameter Engine. It uses a multi-layered discovery system called the **ParameterOptionsComputer** to translate a simple string into a populated list of Revit elements.

## The Three Pillars of Discovery

When you define `[RevitElements(TargetType = "X", Category = "Y")]`, the engine follows a strict priority list to find what you want:

### 1. The Explicit Map (Optimized "Traffic Shortcuts")
Strategy 1 handles the most frequently used types through optimized, direct API paths. These are "shortcuts" designed for speed and precision (e.g., adding specific filters).

**Supported Hardcoded Types:**
- `WallType`, `FloorType`, `RoofType`, `CeilingType`
- `Level`, `Grid`
- `View` (Automatically filters out View Templates)
- `ViewFamilyType`
- `FamilySymbol`, `Family`
- `Material`, `LineStyle`
- `DimensionType`, `TextNoteType`, `FilledRegionType`

### 2. The Smart Category Resolver (The Dynamic Pillar)

If a string is not in the explicit map, the engine uses Strategy 2. This resolver has **two internal stages** and a strong **Type Bias**, with a hard-coded exception for spatial elements.

**Stage 1: Localized Name Match**
1.  **Fuzzy Search**: It scans the Document's categories for a name match. It handles singular/plural fuzzy matching (e.g., "Wall" vs "Walls", "Dimension" vs "Dimensions").
2.  **The Type Interceptor**: It immediately runs a collector for all **Types** in that category.
3.  **The Priority Exit**: 
    - **IF** any Types exist **AND** your search term is NOT exactly **"Room"**, it returns the Types immediately and stops. This is the "Type Bias".
    - This is why `TargetType = "Wall"` always returns WallTypes—it is "intercepted" here because "Wall" != "Room".

**Stage 2: Built-In Enum Match (Language Independent)**
If Stage 1 fails (e.g., in a non-English Revit version where the "Walls" category name is different), the engine uses the `BuiltInCategory` enum (the `OST_` names).
1.  **The Spatial Exception**: If your search term contains **"Room"**, **"Area"**, or **"Space"**, it flips its bias. It pulls **Instances** (`WhereElementIsNotElementType()`) first.
2.  **Standard Fallback**: For everything else, it looks for **Types** first, then falls back to **Instances** only if zero types are found in the project.

**Example Flow: `TargetType = "Walls"`**
- Strategy 1 (Hardcoded): Fails.
- Strategy 2 (Stage 1): Finds the **Walls** category. Since it finds standard **WallTypes** and the name is not "Room", it hits the Type Interceptor.
- Result: Returns the **Types** list and exits.

**Example Flow: `TargetType = "Rooms"`**
- Strategy 1 (Hardcoded): Fails.
- Strategy 2 (Stage 1): Finds the **Rooms** category. Since the search term is exactly **"Room"**, it **skips** the Type Interceptor.
- Strategy 2 (Stage 2): Matches against `BuiltInCategory.OST_Rooms`. Because the term contains "Room", it pulls the **Instance** collector.
- Result: Returns the list of **Placed Rooms**.

## Why the "Spatial" Exception?

In Revit, **Rooms, Areas, and Spaces** are unique. Unlike a Wall (which is an object built from a blueprint/type), a Spatial Element is a volume defined by its surroundings.

While most Revit categories use a clear **Type > Instance** hierarchy, Spatial elements don't provide useful user-facing types. If the engine didn't have this exception, asking for "Rooms" might return obscure internal Revit calculation types instead of the actual room names you see in your floor plans.

To keep the "Magic" working as users expect, the engine groups these three together:
- **Rooms**
- **Areas**
- **Spaces**

### 3. The Class reflector (The Fallback)
If it still hasn't found anything, it uses **Reflection** to look for any class in the `Autodesk.Revit.DB` assembly that matches your name (e.g., if you wrote `TargetType = "ViewSheet"`, it would find the `ViewSheet` class).

---

## Why different strings give the same result?

The engine has built-in **Intent Priority**. It asks: *"Does the user want the Types (blueprints) or the Instances (the things in the model)?"*

### Case A: System Families (Walls, Floors, etc.)
- `TargetType = "Wall"` -> The resolver finds the "Walls" category. 
- It checks: *"Does this category have Type elements?"* **Yes.** 
- Result: It returns all **WallTypes**. This is why it looks identical to `TargetType = "WallType"`.

### Case B: Component/Loadable Families (Doors, Windows, etc.)
- `TargetType = "Doors"` -> Finds "Doors" category. 
- It checks: *"Does this have Types?"* **Yes.**
- For loadable families, the "Types" are `FamilySymbol` objects. 
- Result: It returns all **Family Names + Type Names**. This is why it looks identical to `TargetType = "FamilySymbol", Category = "Doors"`.

### Case C: Element-Only Categories (Rooms, Areas, Materials)
- `TargetType = "Rooms"` -> Finds "Rooms" category.
- It checks: *"Does this have Types?"* **No.** (Rooms are instances only).
- Result: It falls back to **Instances** and returns the names of all placed Rooms in your project.

## The "Instance vs. Type" Limitation

If a category *can* have types (like Walls, Pipes, or Floors), the engine **always** prioritizes the list of Types. 

### Why is `[RevitElements("Wall")]` not giving me instances?
The engine logic (Strategy 1 & 2) has a "Type Bias":
1. It finds the "Walls" category.
2. It queries for `WhereElementIsElementType()`.
3. Since Walls have types, this returns a list.
4. The engine **returns immediately** and never checks for instances.

### How to target Instances of System Families?
To list a dropdown of actual Wall instances in the document, you **cannot** use the attribute magic alone. You must use the **Explicit Provider** (`_Options`) convention:

```csharp
public string? SelectedWallName { get; set; }

// Use the _Options suffix to create an authoritative provider
public List<string> SelectedWallName_Options => new FilteredElementCollector(Doc)
            .OfClass(typeof(Wall))
            .Cast<Wall>()
            .Select(w => w.Name)
            .Distinct()
            .ToList();
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Golden Rule:** 
> - **Attribute Magic** is for **Context & Standards** (Types, Categories, Levels).
> - **Custom Providers (`_Options`)** are for **Live Data & Instances** (Specific Walls, specific Sheets, filtered selections).

## What is Reflection? (Strategy 3)

Strategy 3 in the engine uses a technique called **Reflection**. 

In programming, **Reflection** is the ability of a program to "look at itself"—to examine its own internal structure, classes, and methods at runtime. 

### How Paracore uses it:
When you write `[RevitElements(TargetType = "ViewSheet")]`, the engine follows this exact path:

1.  **Strategy 1 & 2 Fail**: "ViewSheet" is not hardcoded, and it is not a Category name (the category is "Sheets").
2.  **The Mirror (Strategy 3)**: It asks `RevitAPI.dll`: *"Do you have a class called ViewSheet?"*
3.  **The Discovery**: It finds `Autodesk.Revit.DB.ViewSheet`.
4.  **The Execution**: It runs a collector: `new FilteredElementCollector(Doc).OfClass(typeof(ViewSheet))`.

### Does Reflection return Instances or Types?
The answer is: **Whichever one the C# Class itself represents.**

Unlike Strategy 2 (Category), which identifies a group and then **infers** if you want the Type or Instance, Strategy 3 is literal:

- **If the Class is an Instance class**: (e.g., `ViewSheet`, `FamilyInstance`, `BoundaryLocation`).
  - Result: It returns **Instances**.
- **If the Class is a Type class**: (e.g., `WallType`, `TextNoteType`, `DimensionType`).
  - Result: It returns **Types**.

### Case Study: The Sheet "Identity Crisis" (Freedom via _Options)
In the engine, you might find that `TargetType = "ViewSheet"` returns more than you expect (like Plans or Sections) because of how Revit classes inherit from each other. This is the perfect time to use the **Freedom** of the `_Options` masterpiece.

```csharp
public string SheetName { get; set; }

// Using _Options for 100% precision
public List<string> SheetName_Options => new FilteredElementCollector(Doc)
    .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Sheets)
    .WhereElementIsNotElementType()
    .Cast<ViewSheet>()
    .Select(s => $"{s.SheetNumber} - {s.Name}") // Professional "Unmasking" format
    .OrderBy(n => n)
    .ToList();
```

**Why this is the "Freedom" Fix:**
- **Literal Category**: Hits `OST_Sheets` directly, bypassing all name or class "fuzziness."
- **Professional Formatting**: By adding the `SheetNumber`, you distinguish Sheets from Views that might share the same name (e.g., "Level 1" Floor Plan vs "Level 1" Sheet).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Evolutionary Design**: 
> We acknowledge that Revit's API is deep and full of quirks (Sweeps, Reveals, specific Annotation types). It is impossible to predict every conflict ahead of time. Our strategy is to **adjust the "Magic" (Strategies 1 & 2) incrementally** as we encounter real-world automation scenarios. The `_Options` layer ensures you are never blocked while the engine's automated logic evolves.

Strategy 3 is the "Honest Strategy." It does exactly what it's told by the C# type system, with no hidden branching logic.

### Case Study: Dimension vs. DimensionType
This is a perfect example of using Strategy 3 to bypass the default "Type Bias."

```csharp
// 1. Returns a distinctly named list of Dimension instances PLACED in the model.
// (Because of .Distinct(), if 100 dimensions have the same name, only one entry shows).
[RevitElements(TargetType = "Dimension")]
public string DimensionsName { get; set; }

// 2. Returns a list of the Dimension Types (Blueprints) available in the project.
[RevitElements(TargetType = "DimensionType")]
public string DimensionsTypeName { get; set; }
```

**Why this works:**
- **`DimensionType`** hits Strategy 1 (Optimized Map) or finds the Type Class in Strategy 3. It returns **Types**.
- **`Dimension`** bypasses Strategy 2 because of a subtle **Name Mismatch**. The Revit Category is named **"Dimensions"** (Plural). While the engine tries to pluralize, it prioritizes a perfect match. When it hits **Strategy 3 (Reflection)**, it finds a 1:1 match with the C# class `Autodesk.Revit.DB.Dimension`. Since this class represents the instances, it returns the placed elements.

### The "Distinct" Collapse (Why only one entry?)
You noticed that even if you have 100 dimensions, only one of each "type" shows up. This is a deliberate design choice in the engine.

In the C# core, every collection of names is processed with:
```csharp
.Select(e => e.Name).Distinct()
```

**The logic:** 
In Revit, many elements (like Dimensions) don't have a unique "Instance Name". Instead, `element.Name` just returns the name of their Type. 
- If you have 50 dimensions of type "Linear - 3mm", they all report their name as "Linear - 3mm".
- Without `.Distinct()`, your dropdown would have the same name repeated 50 times, which is unusable.
- The engine "collapses" these duplicates to keep the interface clean.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Picking a specific Instance:** 
> If you need to pick **one specific** dimension instance out of many with the same name (e.g., by its ElementID or a unique Comment), you must use the **Explicit Provider (`_Options`)** to generate a list of unique strings (like `$"Dimension: {e.Id}"`).

### The "Plural Mystery": Why `TargetType = "Dimensions"` still gives Instances?
You might expect that typing the plural `"Dimensions"` would force Strategy 2 to find the category and return types. However, there are two reasons why you still see instances:

1.  **The Revit API Quirk**: In the Revit API, many annotation categories (like Dimensions, Text, and Tags) do not return their types when using a category-based `WhereElementIsElementType()` filter. Because this "Type Check" returns zero, Strategy 2 concludes there are no types and falls back to **Instances**.
2.  **Strategy 3 Overlap**: Because Strategy 3 (Reflection) is also singular/plural fuzzy, it can find the `Dimension` class even if you typed `"Dimensions"`. 

This is exactly why **Strategy 1 (Hardcoded)** exists. We hardcoded `"DimensionType"` specifically to bypass these quirks and provide a 100% reliable path to the blueprints.

> [!TIP]
> **Roadmap:** We plan to expand Strategy 1 to include all missing annotation types (Tags, SpotDimensions, etc.) to ensure they are never "invisible" to the engine.

### The "Skip" Logic: Why didn't Strategy 2 win?
You asked a great question: *Why does it skip the Category Resolver?*

The engine is designed to be **Specific > Fuzzy**. 
1.  **Categories (Strategy 2)** are often fuzzy (names change in different languages). 
2.  **Classes (Strategy 3)** are fixed and immutable in the DLL across all languages.

If you type `TargetType = "Dimension"`, the engine checks the categories. In some Revit versions or languages, "Dimension" singular doesn't perfectly match the internal Category name collection. Since there is NO category named exactly "Dimension" (it's always "Dimensions"), Strategy 2 might not be 100% confident. 

It then falls to Strategy 3, sees the class `Autodesk.Revit.DB.Dimension`, and says: "Aha! This is a perfect match for a C# Class. I will use this instead." This is why it feels more predictable—it's using the **exact API class name**.

### Why is this powerful?
- **Zero Maintenance**: If Autodesk adds a new class to Revit, Strategy 3 finds it automatically.
- **Granularity**: You can target specific subclasses that categories might group together.
- **Flexibility**: You can target things that barely feel like elements, such as `FabricationPart`, `LinePatternElement`, or `FillPatternElement`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why is it a "fallback"?**
> Reflection is slower than hardcoded shortcuts (Strategy 1). That's why the engine only uses it as a last resort if it can't find a direct map or a category match.

## The Validation Loop: "Trust, but Verify"

The ultimate power of the Paracore engine is its **instant feedback cycle**. As a script developer, your workflow should follow this loop:

1.  **Define**: Add your property with `[RevitElements]`.
2.  **Inspect**: Immediately check the **Parameters** tab in the Paracore UI.
3.  **Validate**: 
    - Are the correct elements listed in the dropdown? 
    - Is it showing Types when you wanted Instances (or vice-versa)?
4.  **Adjust**: If the list isn't what you expected, refine the definition:
    - Change the `TargetType` string (e.g., add or remove "Type").
    - Add a `Category` filter.
    - Switch to an **Explicit Provider (`_Options`)** for total control.

This "WYSIWYG" (What You See Is What You Get) approach ensures that by the time you share a script for automation, the data feeding into it is exactly what you intended.
